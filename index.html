            <h3>Crab Pithivier with Scallop Frangipane</h3>
            <p>Perfect for a dinner party or any sort of special occasion, this stunning dish from Angie Mar is a
                project
                that's well worth your time. The crab and scallops lend a delicate sweetness, and the sherry sauce
                brings
                nuttiness and brightness. Almond flour is essential</p>
